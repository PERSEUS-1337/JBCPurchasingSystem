## Project Structure Setup

1. Create project folders:
   - `app.js` (main file)
   - `routes/` for API endpoints
   - `models/` for database models
   - `config/` for environment variables and configurations

---

## Dependencies

1. Install necessary dependencies:
   - ExpressJS
   - Database ORM (e.g., Sequelize)
   - Authentication middleware (e.g., Passport.js)
   - Environment variables package (e.g., dotenv)

---

## Database

1. Set up database connection with environment variables.
2. Implement migration scripts for database schema.

---

## API Routes

1. Define routes for core functionalities:
   - User authentication (register, login)
   - Product listing, detail, add, update, delete

---

## Middleware

1. Add essential middleware:
   - CORS for cross-origin resource sharing
   - Error handling

---

## Environment Variables

1. Create `.env.example` for reference.
2. Populate `.env` file with required environment variables.

---

## Authentication

1. Implement user registration and login.
2. Configure JWT for session handling.

---

## Rate Limiting

1. Implement rate limiting to secure API endpoints.

---

## Logging

1. Set up Winston for logging key events and errors.

---

## Testing

1. Write unit tests for:
   - API routes
   - Database operations

---

## Development Environment

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Initialize Git repository.
3. Configure IDE and install development tools:
   - ESLint
   - Prettier
   - TypeScript (optional)

---

## Error Handling

1. Create custom error classes.
2. Set up a global error handler.

---

## API Documentation

1. Use Swagger or a similar tool to document your API.

---

## Caching

1. Set up Redis for caching and session storage.

---

## Monitoring

1. Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and alerting.

---

## CI/CD

1. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.

---

## Docker Setup

1. Configure Docker:
   - Create `Dockerfile`
   - Create `docker-compose.yml`
   - Set environment variables for Docker
   - Test Docker setup locally
2. Deploy Docker containers in production environment.

---

## Additional Tasks

1. Set up email notifications.
2. Implement queue processing (e.g., RabbitMQ).
3. Add API versioning.
4. Integrate logging for slow queries.
5. Configure SSL/TLS certificates.
6. Add security headers.
7. Establish backup and restore procedures.
