# 🗂️ 1. High Level Overview

## :project: 1.1 **Project Introduction**

The **JBC Purchasing System** is a full-stack application developed to digitize and optimize the company's procurement workflow. It replaces the existing manual process—which is prone to inefficiencies, limited traceability, and redundancy in managing **Purchase Requests (PRs)** and **Purchase Orders (POs)**.

Currently, each step—from identifying procurement needs and securing approvals to issuing purchase orders and revalidating them—is performed manually. This results in several operational issues:

- Poor document traceability throughout the project lifecycle.
- High risk of duplicate PRs and POs due to the lack of a centralized tracking system.
- Dependence on paper-based records, making document retrieval and audit processes time-consuming.

The JBC Purchasing System addresses these challenges by automating the end-to-end procurement process. It enables real-time tracking of PRs and POs, ensures approval workflows are streamlined, and minimizes human error. Furthermore, it incorporates a comprehensive Supplier and Supply Database that centralizes historical procurement data, including supplier profiles, pricing history, and past transactions.

## **🔍 1.3 Problems Addressed**

- **Manual and Inefficient Processing** – Eliminates manual handling of **Purchase Requests (PRs)** and **Purchase Orders (POs)** by automating creation, approval, and tracking.
- **Lack of Procurement Visibility** – Establishes systematic tracking of all project-related purchases for improved documentation and traceability.
- **Disconnected PR and PO Workflows** – Seamlessly links PRs to corresponding POs to enhance accountability and process integrity.
- **Approval Bottlenecks** – Introduces an **online approval workflow** to reduce delays and streamline decision-making.
- **Fragmented Supplier and Inventory Data** – Creates a centralized, organized database for efficient supplier and inventory management.
- **Redundant Inquiries on Past Orders** – Enables instant access to historical transactions, minimizing repetitive questions about previously purchased items or prices.

---

## **✅ 1.4 System Goals**

1. **Automate the Procurement Lifecycle** – Streamline PR and PO processing to boost efficiency, reduce manual errors, and ensure consistency.
2. **Enhance Procurement Transparency** – Systematically log and track all procurement activities to support auditability and accountability.
3. **Centralize Supplier and Material Records** – Consolidate supplier details, material specifications, and pricing history into a unified repository.
4. **Accelerate Approval Processes** – Implement an online approval mechanism to reduce turnaround time and improve responsiveness.
5. **Reduce Operational Redundancy** – Prevent duplicate orders and repeated supplier inquiries by enabling access to comprehensive procurement history.
6. **Enforce Compliance and Control** – Maintain adherence to internal policies and procurement standards through structured workflows and validations.

---

## **🎯 1.5 Key Objectives**

1. **Digitize End-to-End Procurement Workflow** – Develop a robust system covering PR initiation, PO issuance, and multi-level approvals.
2. **Establish a Supplier and Inventory Database** – Build a well-structured repository for managing supplier profiles, transaction records, and item pricing.
3. **Enable PR-PO Relationship Mapping** – Ensure that each PR is directly associated with its corresponding PO for enhanced traceability and reporting.
4. **Implement Online Approvals with Notifications** – Integrate real-time email and in-app notifications to facilitate timely actions and updates.
5. **Provide Advanced Search and Reporting Tools** – Equip the system with powerful filters, queries, and reporting features for procurement analysis.
6. **Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Define user roles and permissions to secure sensitive actions and data access.
7. **Optimize for Usability** – Design a user-friendly interface that simplifies navigation and reduces onboarding time for end-users.
8. **Ensure Scalability and System Integration** – Architect the platform for growth and compatibility with future enterprise systems.

## **2.6 Entity Schemas & Attributes**

> *Defines the actual data models per entity. Focuses on field names, data types, optionality, enums, validation rules.*
> 
- For each core domain (PR, PO, PR_ITEM, Supply, Supplier, User):
    - Tabular breakdown of fields
    - Brief notes per field (e.g., derived, required, optional)
    - Optional: constraints, examples, or indexing notes
    - Link to full schema file (if you maintain it in GitHub or Notion Code Blocks)

### 2.6.1 User Schema (`userModel`)

- **📦 Schema Definition**
    
    
    | **Property** | **Data Type** | **Notes** |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | userID | string | Unique HR-defined identifier. Required and unique. Used as human-readable reference. |
    | fullname | string | Full name of the user. Required. |
    | email | string | Stored in lowercase. Required and unique. Used for login and notifications. |
    | password | string | Hashed with bcrypt before saving. Required. |
    | role | string | Enum from userRoleEnums. Defaults to defaultUserRole. Used in RBAC. |
    | position | string | Job position or title. Required. |
    | department | string | Department assignment. Required. |
    | status | string | Enum from userStatusEnums. Defaults to active. Indicates current system access state. |
- **🔍 Additional Details**
    - **🔑 Indexing**:
        - `userID` and `email` are both uniquely indexed to support high-performance lookup and enforce uniqueness constraints.
        - MongoDB's default `_id` is retained for internal relations and joins.
    - **🧠 Password Encryption**:
        - Uses a pre-save middleware hook to hash passwords with bcrypt.
        - Ensures that updates to the password field also trigger re-hashing.
    - **📚 Enumerations**:
        - `role`, `status`, `department`, and `position` reference predefined enums:
            
            ```jsx
            enum UserRoleEnum { requestor, approver, purchasing, admin }
            enum UserStatusEnum { active, inactive, archived }
            ```
            
    - **🕓 Timestamps**:
        - Enabled via timestamps: true, auto-generating `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.
    - **🧪 Example Index Setup**:
        
        ```jsx
        userSchema.index({ userID: 1 }, { unique: true });
        userSchema.index({ email: 1 }, { unique: true });
        ```
        
- **🔄 Suggested Usage**
    
    
    | **Use Case** | **Suggested Field** |
    | --- | --- |

- **📝 Additional Details**
    - **🧾 prID** is the external reference (used in UI, links, exports). MongoDB _id is still retained internally for technical operations.
    - **📎 Foreign Keys**: projCode, requestedBy, recommendedBy, and approvedBy all link to external collections (projects, users).
    - **📊 status** is a derived field based on approver actions and should not be modified directly by users.

- **UM-102**: Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- **UM-103**: Role assignments (`role`) must be one of the predefined enums: `requestor`, `approver`, `purchasing`, `admin`, `superadmin`.
- **UM-104**: Deactivated users (`status: inactive`) cannot log in or perform any actions.
- **UM-105**: All critical user actions (e.g., login, role changes) must be logged with timestamps and user IDs.
- **UM-106**: User passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
- **UM-107**: Only the `superAdmin` can create user accounts.

- **UM-109**: Users with the `superadmin` role cannot be deleted or deactivated by any other role, including `admin`.
- **UM-110**: Failed login attempts exceeding 5 times within 15 minutes will temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes.
- **UM-111**: User sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity, requiring re-authentication.
- **UM-112**: All user data exports (e.g., CSV reports) must exclude sensitive fields like `password` and include only anonymized or aggregated data where possible.

### **Supply & Inventory Module**
- **INV-101**: Supply items must have a unique `supplyID` and `name`.
- **INV-102**: `unitCost` is derived as the minimum `unitPrice` from `supplierPricing`.
